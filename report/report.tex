Final Report — due: 13th Jan 2014, at 16:00 (both Electronic and Hardcopy)

Contents for Final Report: The project report should not be longer than 35 pages (recommended length is around 30 pages), and might be organised according to the following structure:

    A. Executive Summary
        Your 'elevator pitch'
        What is your Project? What does it do? Why would I want to buy it? etc.
        No implementation, software engineering details, or project management 
    B. Introduction
        Set the scene ('motivation')
        State the problem you are trying to solve ('objective(s)')
        Summarise your main achievements 
    C. Design and implementation
        Detail your design (why did you do it this way?) - design of your software, possibly including a diagram of the major components
        Summarise key implementation details (how did you do it? what technology was used and why? what other technology was considered, but not used and why?
        Any technical challenges encountered and how addressed?
        Any risks anticipated, and how mitigated 
    D. Evaluation
        Evaluate your deliverables e.g. performance, usability, etc.
        Summarise testing procedures (+ relevant testing results) 
    E. Conclusion and future extensions
        What did you learn? What might you have done differently?
        How would you build on what you have done? 
    F. Project management
        Planning, group organisation, breakdown + task allocation etc. 
    G. Bibliography
    H. Appendix The appendix is optional, and does not count towards the 35 pages. It may contain thing like: User guide, installation instructions; more extensive design, testing, statistics etc.

Make sure that the final report presents a coherent story. Ask advice from your supervisor. You might also draw inspiration from the instructions about writing up your individual project.

Bear in mind, that most of the project assessors will not have followed the project throughout and will only have a short time to listen to a presentation or see a demonstration. For this reason they will rely heavily on the report to judge the project.

The report should be submitted to SGO in form of a hard copy, as well as electronically through CATE. i.e. report.pdf.

Assessment
Will be updated soon.

Group project
The group project assessment is undertaken by each group's supervisor, and moderated by a larger group of assessors, who will attend your presentation, and/or read your final report. The assessment is based on:

    Executive Summary, 5%
    Presentation, 10%
    Group Collaboration and Management, 20%
    Report, 30%
    Technical Achievement, 35%

The group project (along with the Software Engineering course) is worth 440 Marks for both the MEng and BEng students.
Overall assessment
The overall assessment is the sum of the group project component and the Software Engineering Course in an 80:20 split.
